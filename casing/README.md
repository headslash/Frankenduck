# Case

The case is just a clampshell design using the switch plate as a way to mount the pcb. this cuts the cost on the pcb but requires a decently made switchplate to work properly.

Here's a refference to the different ways to mount a keyboard into a case.
I'm going for the sandwich mount.

The case is effective and the 1.5mm polycarbonate cutouts work perfectly to get the visual I was aiming for.

The stl's and dxf's are available for the parts.
