# PCB design

The form factor was kept, it was logical and it was one of the elements that drew me to this board.

The design is done fully in altium hencefort I've got both 2D and 3D models of it to show atm while waiting on the pcb.
The downside is that I still need to convert the files to make it usable/editable.

The second Version of the pcb's is currently on its way from a manufacturer.
There was an issue with the connector of the amoled screen pinout being reversed by me.
