# PCB design

The form factor was kept, it was logical and it was one of the elements that drew me to this board.

I'm gonna make the gerber files available. These are currently on their way to me and not have been tested.
I'm placing the gerbers because not alot of people have altium to their exposal.

Most pcb manufacturers will accept these gerber files without any needed modification.

The Second V1pcb version has been tested and works perfectly.


## V1.1 Top layer
The 3d View is almost identical between the 2 versions.

## soldering the components yourself

In case you're planning on soldering the pcb yourself here's a component list and layout for the Resistors and capacitors.
The other components are quite self explanatory.
