# PCB design

The form factor was kept, it was logical and it was one of the elements that drew me to this board.

I'm gonna make the gerber files available. These are currently on their way to me and not have been tested.
I'm placing the gerbers because not alot of people have altium to their exposal.

Most pcb manufacturers will accept these gerber files without any needed modification.

The second Version of the pcb's is currently on its way from a manufacturer.
There was an issue with the connector of the amoled screen pinout being reversed by me.
