# Working product/Sale

NOTICE: I'm currently NOT selling the kit due to the silicon shortage and a redesing of the pcb I'm making.
The pcb design is for easier manufacturing and more personal modification on the up and down keys.
This version is made in KICAD and the files for that will be made available when finished.

This keyboard now works flawlessly in its V1.1 form and the Visuals work out as I intended.

And with that I'm gonna sell some on them to get some of the investment cost out of it.
If you want a complete one or a pcb hit me up on discord `headslash#8967` or ask for me in [official duckyPad discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5).
I'm quite open to custom colors on the case or partchoice.

Pricewise I'm looking at around 
60 Euro for a full kit with all parts except the switches and keycaps.
70 Euro for a fully soldered pcb except the switches and keycaps.
These kits include a 3dprinted case and acrylic.
The shipping cost is not included in the price.

For shipping outside the EU we're generally looking at these prices:
Fully soldered including the case (no switches) would be around 102 euro.
Without the printed case it would be around 75 bucks

Any variant or parts kit can also be aquired, just ask, I'm open to alot of stuff.
