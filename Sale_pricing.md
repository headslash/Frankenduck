# Working product/Sale

This keyboard now works flawlessly in its V1.1 form and the Visuals work out as I intended.

And with that I'm gonna sell some on them to get some of the investment cost out of it.
If you want a complete one or a pcb hit me up on discord `headslash#8967` or ask for me in [official duckyPad discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5).
I'm quite open to custom colors on the case or partchoice.

Pricewise I'm looking at around 
60 Euro for a full kit with all parts except the switches and keycaps.
70 Euro for a fully soldered pcb except the switches and keycaps.
These kits include a 3dprinted case and acrylic.
The shipping cost is not included in the price.

Any variant or parts kit can also be aquired, just ask, I'm open to alot of stuff.
