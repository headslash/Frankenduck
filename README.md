This project is a hardware rework of dekuNukem's duckypad project.
I liked the whole promise of the project but the lack of protection for it in a more EDC style role was a bit off putting.
So because I had to read up into altium for my job I made it a goal for myself to redo the pcb.
I ontop of that also am making a 3dprinted body body for it to house everything.

## Original project

The original project Where I took the schematic from and probably gonna implement his very all-encompassing software package from is:  
[dekuNukems duckypad project](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad).
[the schematic in question ](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/pcb/lul.sch).  
You can view the schematic easily with eagle or by importing the file to [a site like this](https://www.altium.com/viewer/).

Also go take a look at the [official duckyPad discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5). 
The original designer and I are both active there.

## Overview

My goal with the hardware redesign is a more rugid and more portable design while still being stylish and usable.
A case for a more rugid design.
Implementing the top and bottom switch plate in acrylic to keep the pcb and amoled visible but still keep it protected.
The acrylic also gives a nice effect on the sides where the light can seep through.

### pcb design

The schematic is exactly the same other than the 2 layer selection switches now being actual mechanical switches.

I worked in altium so I still need to find a way to export the the project to easier accesible formats for other programs.

Now I'm waiting on parts, I mainly recieved most of it but some parts are still being shipped.
